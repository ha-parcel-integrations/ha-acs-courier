# populated), in PENDING_CAPABILITIES (docs site shows "awaiting data"), or in
# neither (the API never exposes it). Pending fields must still come back as a
# literal ``None`` from normalize_parcel() until they are confirmed and moved
# into CAPABILITIES. A multi-backend carrier declares
# PENDING_CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT with the same keys as its
# CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT instead (omit backends with nothing pending).

# key exactly as the carrier's own country/backend selector does. The docs
# site's generator accepts either shape — don't declare both. Do not add this
# preemptively: a single-backend carrier (the common case) keeps the flat
# CAPABILITIES above.
